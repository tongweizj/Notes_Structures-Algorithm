#### **Q4. What is the software development life cycle? What are the differences between them?** 

SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time. SDLC includes a detailed plan for how to develop, alter, maintain, and replace a software system.

SDLC involves several distinct stages, including planning, design, building, testing, and deployment. Popular SDLC models include the [waterfall model](http://learnaccessvba.com/application_development/waterfall_method.htm), [spiral model](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/spiral-model), and [Agile model](http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-agile-model-advantages-disadvantages-and-when-to-use-it/).

#### **Q6. What is responsive design? What is the difference between fixed and fluid layouts?** 

1.  **Responsive website design.** Websites that are built with responsive design use media queries to target breakpoints that scale images, wrap text, and adjust the layout so that the website can ‘shrink to fit’ any size of screen, such as the difference between desktops and mobiles.
2.  **Fluid website design.** Websites that are built with fluid design use percentages as relative indicators for widths.
3.  **Fixed design.** Websites that are built using fixed design rely on fixed pixel widths. While a design with fixed dimensions can sometimes be the quickest way to get up and running, it’ll provide a less user-friendly experience across multiple devices.

#### **Q7. What is your process to test and find bugs in an application?**

[Software testing](https://appus.software/blog/the-importance-of-quality-assurance-management-why-you-should-consider-it) is a universally expected part of software development You need to create sets of tests and assessments to be conducted at various development stages. In fact, testing should be carried out at all stages of development, including after your main launch. Things change, platforms are updated, and errors in mobile apps that were not visible before an OS update can wreak havoc.

Usually, this means viewing the application as a whole and as their component pieces, then setting priorities in any areas that you think are more at risk than others. Tests are then conducted to confirm the functionality, and the detected defects are subsequently recorded. These defects can then be prioritized depending on their impact and severity.
