# 一些准备BQ (behavioral questions)的资源,附samples

经历3个月的挣扎，职场小白最近刚刚跳槽成功，总结了一些有助于准备BQ的资源。. 

## 我自己准备BQ的思路一般是

- 仔细读JD
  总结出来职位要求的soft skills (communication, time management, teamwork, attention to detail, analytical thinking, prioritizing, problem solving, etc)

- 每个skill下面列出2个sample question
  不需要太多因为基本换汤不换药)

- 去Google / YouTube 搜sample answer
  我比较喜欢后者因为有视频可以模仿说话的语调)

- 把自己工作 / 在学校碰到的scenario揉进sample answer
  STAR模型，[介绍在这](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)

- 所有的问题和答案总结成一个doc
  列出key points
  或者详细的回答

- Practice talking through your answers out loud 
  一定要练熟，面试的时候不要让面试官听起来你在背答案

## Resources

- 有LinkedIn Premium的可以Google linkedin interview questions
里面有很多sample QA (建议在找工期间可以开Premium,有一些内容还是有用的)

#### YouTube Chanel

- Linda Raynier
  讲话很温和，语音语调我都喜欢。
  
  会提供很多BQ问题的examples，最重要的是会对整个面试宏观层面提出一些建议。
  
  我喜欢这个博主

  这个风格博主讲话很夸张，讲的内容基本和前两个博主一样，但是视频做的比较有意思，很生动。我看她的视频主要是想被她的那种energy感染一下，用到面试里。但是听多了脑袋会有点疼。。。.--

### Tips:
- 我之前准备BQ的时候还参考了地里面这个帖子https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-566677-1-1.html；
- 尽量让BQ成为一个two-way的conversation；
- 个人感觉面试的时候心态非常重要：

真的不要过度重视面试，过度重视很容易导致患得患失（楼主之前面试前一周都吃不好睡不好，结果面试结果也不好，后来干脆放开了，努力准备就完事儿了，挂就挂，继续找就是了），所以一定放松心态；      

充分准备，紧张的很大原因是准备不充分，准备充足基本不用紧张了，面试官有时候比面试人还紧张；
自信，自信，既然被捞起来了就说明有一些skills被HR看上了，这个时候present真实的自己就行了；
  ​      把我们能control的部分准备好，剩下不能control的就不要想太多了。
