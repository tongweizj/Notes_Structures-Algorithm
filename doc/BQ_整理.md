大家可以准备5到8个例子，利用STAR method （Situation, Task, Action,Result)来把例子写下来。

尽量写的详细一些。



最好是那种一个例子可以cover很多个问题的，写下来每个例子可以cover的LP。



核心要义就是体现你是一个

- good team player，
- good problem solver 。



然后在练习讲的时候可以针对具体问题对例子进行删减。

远程面试的好处是可以直接把例子打开现场快速查找。

不过不要照着读，一定要现场组织语言。

准备足够以后基本上听完面试官的问题就大概知道面试官想听到的点是什么。

一个小技巧是听完题以后，不要着急回答。

和面试官说give me 30 seconds to think about a good example，利用这个时间来组织一下语言，想一下用哪个例子，侧重点是什么。

   

在面试中如果遇到非常规题，不要慌张，还是通过那30秒来快速回想一个例子。

如果实在想不到合适的例子，千万不要现场编造。

可以直接和面试官说想不到一个例子。这是没关系的，

我谷歌和fb的面试都遇到了没有例子的问题，面试官就直接move到下一题了。
