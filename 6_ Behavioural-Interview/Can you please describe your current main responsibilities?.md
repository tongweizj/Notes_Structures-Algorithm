I currently work at an IoT company. 
Our company's business involves monitoring environmental conditions in community flood reservoirs for the government. 
This includes monitoring oxygen levels, water depth, water temperature, air temperature, and more. 

My main responsibilities are divided into three areas. 
Firstly, I builds a dashboard using Vue and Nuxt frameworks to display the monitoring data of the reservoirs. 
Secondly, I monitor the operation of various hardware devices in the IoT network and create a monitoring website using Express to showcase the status of the reservoirs. In case of any issues, alerts are sent via email and text messages. 
Lastly, I develop a field application using Flutter for construction personnel. This app allows them to mark the locations of reservoirs on a map and upload construction site photos during equipment maintenance.

These are my primary responsibilities, which demonstrate my technical skills and development experience. I truly enjoy these tasks and take pride in contributing to the safety and environmental protection of our communities.
