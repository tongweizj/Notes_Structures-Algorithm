At the close of the interview, most interviewers ask whether you have any questions about the job or company. If you don’t have any questions, this can make it seems like you are apathetic about the opportunity. So, it's always a good idea to have a list ready and to be prepared to respond.

Bonus Questions

Here are some related questions that you may be asked during a job interview that will require some thought to answer. Consider how you'd respond, so you're as prepared as possible to answer the hiring manager's questions.





When interviewing a potential software engineer, it is important not just to ask them questions but to allow them to ask their own questions.

If an engineer doesn’t really care about your company and is just interested in making money, they probably won’t have a lot of questions.

In addition, a good software engineer who cares about their work is in high demand, and cares about working with a great team will probably have a few questions for you as well. 

They might want to ask about the company culture, the work-life balance, your company values, the goals you are trying to reach, what you are looking for in a software developer and more to figure out whether you would make a good fit for them and how they will fit in with your overall company goals.
