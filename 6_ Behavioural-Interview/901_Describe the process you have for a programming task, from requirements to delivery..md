## 回答

Software development involves the entire life cycle of software, 
- from gathering requirements and designing the system architecture,
- to coding, testing,
- at the last ，deployment and maintaining

The goal of software development is to efficiently build functional solutions for users.

As a programmer, I collaborate with various roles throughout the software development process. Here's a breakdown of how I work and work with different stakeholders at each stage:

1. Requirements gathering
	1.  Working closely with business analysts to understand project goals,  discussions, and providing technical insights.
2.  Requirement analysis
	1. Agreeing on technical and user requirements, documenting them in a Software Requirement Specification, and selecting the software development approach.
3.  System design
	 define the system architecture，and preparing a Design Specification Document.
4. Coding and implementation
	Writing code based on the system design, collaborating with other programmers, and ensuring consistent coding standards and modularization.
-   Testing
	 Working closely with testers to define test cases, identify and fix bugs, and perform code reviews.
-   Deployment and maintenance:
	Coordinating with system administrators and DevOps engineers for smooth deployment and configuration, and collaborating with technical support teams for ongoing maintenance and support.

By working closely with different roles and leveraging each other's expertise, we can collectively deliver high-quality software solutions that meet customer needs and expectations.

1. The software development process or life cycle is a structure applied to the development of a software product. There are several models for such processes (such as the agile method), each describing approaches to a variety of tasks or activities that take place during the process.

2.  **Requirements analysis.** Extracting the requirements of a desired software product is the first task in creating it. While customers probably believe they know what the software is to do, it may require skill and experience in software engineering to recognize incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory requirements.
3.  **Specification.** Specification is the task of precisely describing the software to be written, in a rigorous way. In practice, most successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.
4.  **Software architecture.** The architecture of a software system refers to an abstract representation of that system. Architecture is concerned with making sure the software system will meet the requirements of the product, as well as ensuring that future requirements can be addressed.





Software development is the process programmers use to build computer programs. The process, also known as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), includes several phases that provide a method for building products that meet technical specifications and user requirements.

The SDLC provides an international standard that software companies can use to build and improve their computer programs. It offers a defined structure for development teams to follow in the design, creation and maintenance of high-quality software. The aim of the IT software development process is to build effective products within a defined budget and timeline.

## Key steps in the software development process

There are six major steps in the software development life cycle, including:

### 1. Needs identification

Needs identification is a market research and brainstorming stage of the process. Before a firm builds software, it needs to perform extensive market research to determine the product's viability.

Developers must identify the functions and services the software should provide so that its target consumers get the most out of it and find it necessary and useful. There are several ways to get this information, including feedback from potential and existing customers and surveys.

The IT teams and other divisions in the company must also discuss the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of the product. Software development processes start only if the product satisfies every parameter necessarily for its success.

### 2. Requirement analysis

Requirement analysis is the second phase in the software development life cycle. Here, stakeholders agree on the technical and user requirements and specifications of the proposed product to achieve its goals. This phase provides a detailed outline of every component, the scope, the tasks of developers and testing parameters to deliver a quality product.

The requirement analysis stage involves developers, users, testers, project managers and quality assurance. This is also the stage where programmers choose the software development approach such as the waterfall or V model. The team records the outcome of this stage in a Software Requirement Specification document which teams can always consult during the project implementation.

### 3. Design

Design is the third stage of the software development process. Here, architects and developers draw up advanced technical specifications they need to create the software to requirements. Stakeholders will discuss factors such as risk levels, team composition, applicable technologies, time, budget, project limitations, method and architectural design.

The Design Specification Document (DSD) specifies the architectural design, components, communication, front-end representation and user flows of the product. This step provides a template for developers and testers and reduces the chances of flaws and delays in the finished product.

### 4. Development and implementation

The next stage is the development and implementation of the design parameters. Developers code based on the product specifications and requirements agreed upon in the previous stages. Following company procedures and guidelines, front-end developers build interfaces and back-ends while database administrators create relevant data in the database. The programmers also test and review each other's code.

Once the coding is complete, developers deploy the product to an environment in the implementation stage. This allows them to test a pilot version of the program to make performance match the requirements.

### 5. Testing

The testing phase checks the software for bugs and verifies its performance before delivery to users. In this stage, expert testers verify the product's functions to make sure it performs according to the requirements analysis document.

Testers use exploratory testing if they have experience with that software or a test script to validate the performance of individual components of the software. They notify developers of defects in the code. If developers confirm the flaws are valid, they improve the program, and the testers repeat the process until the software is free of bugs and behaves according to requirements.

### 6. Deployment and maintenance

Once the software is defect-free, the developers can deliver it to customers. After the release of a software's production version, the IT software development company creates a maintenance team to manage issues clients encounter while using the product. Maintenance can be a hot-fix if it is a minor issue but severe software failures require an update.
