The first thing that caught my eye when I saw the position. posted was definitely that it was at EFG Advisers. 

展现了解这家公司
I know that you build a lot of your tools in-house, that the team is small, and that you employ a variety of long- and short-term strategies in the U.S. equities markets focusing on quantitative approaches.

个人职业道路和职位的结合
I’ve been interested in switching to finance for a while now and have been actively managing my own personal portfolio for a few years.

I’m really excited to learn more and see how I’ll be able to contribute to the firm.
