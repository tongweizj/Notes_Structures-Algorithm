One area where I have struggled in the past is public speaking, particularly when addressing large groups. It's like being a dumpling stuck inside a teapot, where the small opening restricts me from expressing my ideas freely. However, I've noticed that this doesn't hold me back when I'm in smaller groups or among friends.

Recognizing the importance of overcoming this weakness, I've taken steps to improve my public speaking skills.

Last year, I set a goal to present in front of larger audiences, which culminated in delivering a company-wide presentation on a new feature. This experience has boosted my confidence significantly, and I've received valuable feedback from others in the meeting.

I continue to push myself to grow and become more comfortable when presenting, as I believe effective communication is crucial for career development.


我的缺点是比较内向，会感觉害羞在别人面前说话。
朋友总说我是在茶壶里煮饺子。因为茶壶的口子很小，没法把饺子倒出来。像现在面试，你肯定能看出来非常紧张，我不是不知道怎么回答，只是单纯的因为害羞没法发挥出自己的正常水平。写代码会让我舒服很多。

# What is your greatest strength



这个问题的本质，还是要根据招聘者来回答。

要想清楚他认为产品经理最重要的能力是什么，那就回答什么！

告诉对方想知道、想听到的答案。

这才是比较好的回答方法。

At my last job, every February of each year, we would have an interview, just boss and me, we would talk about how about my work, good or bad，just like growing, teamwork and other things.

I remember, one time, my boss told me that he thought my greatest strength was always could Get things done before the deadline. So he always gave something hard work. Because he knows I could do it. He need not to worry about it.

When I worked at Koudai, I remembered, one times, my leader told me that he thought my greatest strength was always Get things done before the deadline. So when he need to deal with hard work, he always send it to me. Because he knew I could do it. He need not to worry about it.

I think he was right. I am a old brid, I had managed product more than 10, I had work with more than hunderds people. I always do my best at the work. I always let my team be best.






My greatest weakness!

At the beginning of my career, be a product manager.



1. What is your greatest weakness? - Best Answers

Another typical question interviewers will ask is about your weaknesses. Do your best to frame your answers around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee, turning seeming “weaknesses” into strengths. For example, you might say something like, “I’ve always struggled with perfectionism – I truly want to do the job correctly the first time, but this sometimes means that I devote more time to a project than is necessary. I’ve learned to balance this drive with the equally important responsibility of meeting deadlines.”

You can also share examples of skills you have improved, providing specific instances of how you have recognized a weakness and taken steps to improve yourself.

My greatest weakness!
At the early of my career, I am a coder and then change to product position at 8 years before.
I never forgot these days, I used developer's langue to talk with designers, Operator, and other workmates, they look me like an ET.

I know must fix it. So, I find the book list of the product, buy them from Amazon, Then read and read. And go to PD meetup, listen other people how to say it. Maybe 2 months late, I think I can talk like a product manager, not an ET.

I think I also have some weakness at my work now, but I always happy to fix them when I find them. Our Chinese have a idiom, 活到老学到老，this sentence meaning is we need study if we alive.
